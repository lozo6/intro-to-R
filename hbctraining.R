# Part 1.1

x <- 3

y <- 5

y

x + y

number <- x + y

x <- 5

y <- 10

# Try changing the value of the variable x to 5. What happens to number?
## number would now be 5 + 5 = 10
#Now try changing the value of variable y to contain the value 10. What do you need to do, to update the variable number?
## You need to assign y <- 10
